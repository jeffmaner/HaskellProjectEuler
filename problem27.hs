-- Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
-- 
-- n + n + 41
-- 
-- It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive
-- values n = 0 to 39. However, when n = 40, 402 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is
-- divisible by 41, and certainly when n = 41, 41 + 41 + 41 is clearly
-- divisible by 41.
-- 
-- The incredible formula  n - 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80
-- primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The product of the
-- coefficients, -79 and 1601, is -126479.
-- 
-- Considering quadratics of the form:
-- 
--     n + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| < 1000
-- 
--     where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
--     e.g. |11| = 11 and |-4| = 4
-- 
-- Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression
-- that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n,
-- starting with n = 0.

-- I don't even know where to begin on this. The solution on the Haskell site is
-- good, but there's no explanation given--it's like they just pulled it out of
-- the air. So I'm not going to reproduce it here.
-- There some more comprehensible F# solutions, though.

-- From http://theburningmonk.com/2010/09/project-euler-problem-27-solution/:
-- (ran for several minutes in the IDE, so I killed it).
-- (Found a bug that may have caused it to run indefinitely...)

        count a b = findIndex notPrime $ map (\n->n*n + a*n + b) [0..]
-- (Just 71, -61, 971). Much slower. Probably j<-[-999..999].
